Capstone Project; Flexbox; CSS Advanced Positioning, Responsive Web Design: Media Queries used to avoid breaks during page scaling and for various size viewports. 
Aesthetically, I used a complementary color scheme. Blues are known to be utilized for business and scholastic websites, and to convey trust. With this in mind, I used 2 fairly, light blues for the base color and a deeper blue to draw user attention to click buttons. A vibrant marigold hue was used to attract the user to click buttons and informational sections; Start Here and Read More. I used a deep taupe hue for the typography to contrast against the base color, which i felt was softer in readability than the basic black. Helvetica was used for the typography since it is classic and professional in appearance. 
Minimal transitional animation was used at the informational sections to give the web site some activity, to stimulate the user with some interaction, and guide the user eye through some seamless, fluid movement.
